# Wallpaper changer - Bing

- **Operating system:** Linux (Ubuntu or other with GNOME desktop)

Download a new Bing wallpaper for the day and set it as your desktop background.


### Settings

Write a YAML config file (`config/custom.yml`) to set:
- your wallpaper directory (`:wallpaper_dir`) - where downloaded images shall be kept
- how often to update the wallpaper (`:delay_in_days`)
- whether to log program actions and in which file (`:log`)

As a reference, use `config/default.yml`, where all the possible settings are shown.
